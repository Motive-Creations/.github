## Welcome To Motive Creations!

We are a small group of coders/developers based in NJ. We're devoted to making simplistic and useful tools for everyone to use! Our official webpage is [here!](https://motivecreate.wixsite.com/home)

We are always looking for new and innovative coders to help us with our coding. Unfortunately, we are currently not accepting applications.
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
